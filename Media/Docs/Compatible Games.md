## Compatible Games

Note that all games that have pokemon whose shiny form can be obtained by the soft reset method are compatible with the program, but it's only been tested on BDSP, for now. Some minor modifications may be necessary to adapt it to other games, which I will focus on in the future, after solving other more important stuff.
